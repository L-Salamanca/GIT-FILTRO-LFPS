## GIT FILTRO LFPS

This project was created with the purpose of making a crud about cities that represents changes in the interface and the system as such.
There are multiple functionalities and version control methods to better understand each change, it also works as a test of 
my python and git skills, you can register cities, delete them, among other options.
